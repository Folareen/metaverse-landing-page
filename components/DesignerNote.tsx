                This design shows opportunities embeded in the “once a fiction, now a reality” concept called Metaverse. A very educative design that shows how awesome the world of technology has become. No one would have thought Metaverse would be this important that “technology giants” are willing to invest billions of dollars to get the most out of the idea. I read that with Metaverse, communication would become so interactive that I can show you every detail about whatever I am saying. With the use of VR and AR, everything would be in another era entirely. Imagine teaching History with VR and AR, that will be absolutely amazing. Seeing World War II like it’s happening at the very moment, wow, that would be an absolutely wonderful experience.
                I came across a video on the internet recently, the video showed how VR and AR is being used in the world of Medicine. The surgeon was analysing the human body, showing every detail about the body parts, internal organs and how blood flows in human body. It was so educative and amazing. He didn’t just stop there, he was picking out the organs and showing the exact thing that would happen without that organ in human body. The video should be the best video I’ve seen this year about futuristic technology.
                I am very sure this would be a very successful project if well studied and patiently created. I also hope with this kind of things, Teleportation would also come to reality one day.
